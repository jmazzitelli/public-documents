For use within CalTopo maps.

Icons must not be larger than 24x24. They will be scaled to 24x24 by CalTopo.

Ideally, they should be SVG but can be PNG (note: GiMP doesn't support creating SVG)

Each icon is available in black. Black icons can be used for custom icons and colorized within CalTopo. Custom icons are a CalTopo Pro subscription feature.

You can copy these icons and color them directly within the .png. This is useful for creating icons using the Icon URLs in CalTopo. You only need to use Icon URLs if you do not have a Pro subscription. In this case, the color would be fixed within the icon .png and cannot be changed within CalTopo. Icon URLs would be the github URL with the query string `?raw=true`.

There are also some free icons available here: https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com/category/markers/

You can ask ChatCPT or Gemini to try to generate icons as well.
