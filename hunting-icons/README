For use within CalTopo maps.

Icons must not be larger than 24x24. They will be scaled to 24x24 by CalTopo.

Ideally, they should be SVG but can be PNG (note: GiMP doesn't support creating SVG)

Each icon is available in black and color.

* Black can be used for custom icons and colorized within CalTopo. Custom icons are a CalTopo Pro subscription feature.
* Color are for Icon URLs for those without Pro subscriptions; the color is fixed within the icon and cannot be changed within CalTopo. Icon URLs are the github URL with the query string `?raw=true`.

There are some free icons available here: https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com/category/markers/

You can ask ChatCPT or Gemini to try to generate icons.
